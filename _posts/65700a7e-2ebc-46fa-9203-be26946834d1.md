  Was it so in earlier times? Is it in any case the fact that humanity has
  always diminished and twisted with distance-distance geographical or social:
  rather like those neighbours of the Lugbara who became ever more peculiar and
  inverted (for the Lugbara) as the kilometres clocked up between? There may be
  something in this. Writing in the fifth century B.C., Herodotus had evidently
  to cope with rather few problems of racist mythology, of built-in assumptions
  (or neuroses) about sin and virtue, either as to himself or to the Greeks for
  whom he wrote, and whether in respect of the peoples of the Nile and North
  Africa or even of those "blameless Ethiopians" who lived beyond the reach of
  his travels and who were, or so he told the Greeks, said to be the
  best-looking people anywhere. Doubts began in Asia rather than Africa, for
  beyond the Asian Issedones were the one-eyed Arimaspians, clearly not quite
  satisfactorily human, and beyond them again the griffins who guarded the gold,
  obviously still less so. But who had ever seen them? On the other hand, the
  Greeks were close to their neighbours over the water; and anyone who cares to
  look at the busts and portraits of Africans made in those times, and right on
  through the Hellenist centuries, will find the relationship to have been one
  of interested acceptance of a "different but equal" humanity. And was it the
  same the other way round? At least from what Herodotus says and implies, it
  seems to have been so.
